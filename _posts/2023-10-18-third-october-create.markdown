Come join us on Wednesday for our third create night of October, starting at 6.  

I did what I set out to do last week and was able to do some silk eco prints
over the weekend.  I can do some show and tell if anyone is interested. 

For this week, I really love the look of illuminated reed and paper sculptures,
especially the nautilus and other organic shapes. I've only experimented once
and still have reed so I might try my hand at it again this week.  I won't get
better without practice ðŸ˜‡
