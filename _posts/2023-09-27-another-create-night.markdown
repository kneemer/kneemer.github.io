Last week we worked on making a flag banner out of some practice eco prints that
I did on small square cotton flags.  It was all sitting on a shelf not being
used and is now over 40 feet of flags on a cord that can be used for festivals
or whatever. We left some extra cord because I still have some blank flags we could eco dye sometime.

Previously, I've suggested an agenda/project but have found that we don't follow and just go with whatever we feel like.  Soooo, I'm not proposing
anything this week, just come and play.

Once we have a little continuity and projects accumulated, I can add some images
of projects worked on for inspiration and modify the website to be more than
a simple list of events.

Hope to see you on Wednesday.  Starts at 6
