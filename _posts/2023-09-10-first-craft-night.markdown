The first craft night will be on Wednesday, September 13th from 6-?

You are welcome to bring whatever you want but I thought I would provide
a specific craft for our first get together.

I have an intermediate screen printing kit that I haven't used yet and plan on going
through the directions and making some things.

Bring heavy paper or cloth you want to print on, if interested.  The kit comes
with black and red ink but I also have some smaller amounts
of other primary colors if needed.k

A couple images of the kit to give us ideas :)
