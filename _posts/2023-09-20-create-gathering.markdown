Playing with renaming the night to Create so that it isn't confined to just
crafts.  Maybe someone wants to create music or stories and I would love to host
such a thing. :) 

I will be hosting again tomorrow, September 20th starting at 6.

We did not get to the screen printing last week so that is still available.
I have been wanting to use these large tubes I have to make fake trees in my
craft space so I might get started on that if we don't do screen printing.  I'm
also happy to do anything else that comes up.
