Come join us on Wednesday for our second create night of October, starting at 6.  

The leaves are turning and I haven't prepped fabrics for eco printing. I pulled
out last year's experiments for inspiration and left them out if people want to
see them. Hoping to get some fabrics ready for this year's experiments during
create night.

I don't want to lose out on the seasonal opportunity. 🍂 🍁
